# 🌐 Internal Code Sharing Repository

Welcome to the **Internal Code Sharing Repository**!  
This is a **public GitHub repository within the team** created to promote efficient collaboration between teams by offering a central hub to share reusable scripts, utilities, and code modules.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository exists to foster **collaboration, code reuse, and knowledge sharing** across different internal teams.

Key goals include:

- Eliminating redundancy by sharing solutions to common problems
- Providing a single source of truth for utility code
- Accelerating development through collaboration
- Maintaining a library of best practices and tested implementations

Whether you're building automation scripts, helper functions, CLI tools, or data pipelines — if it’s reusable and helpful, it belongs here!

## ✅ DOs and ❌ DON'Ts

### ✅ What to Do (Best Practices)

| ✅ Action                               | 💡 Why It Matters                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Create a folder with a clear name      | Helps others understand the purpose instantly      |
| Add a README.md inside your folder       | Explains your code and how to use it               |
| Comment and document your code            | Enhances readability and usability                 |
| Write modular, reusable code             | Encourages reuse across projects                   |
| Follow naming conventions and code style | Keeps things consistent                            |
| Add a .gitignore for temp files           | Prevents clutter in the repository                 |
| Write clean, meaningful commit messages | Improves traceability and context                  |
| Mention known issues or limitations     | Saves others time and confusion                    |
| Keep dependencies lightweight and documented | Avoids bloat and confusion                       |

### ❌ What Not to Do (Common Pitfalls)

| ❌ Avoid This | 🚫 Why It's a Problem |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Don’t push secrets or credentials | Exposes your system to security risks |
| Don’t upload large binaries or datasets | Git is not designed for heavy files |
| Don’t overwrite others' code or folders | Respects peer contributions |
| Don’t include unnecessary files (logs, temp) | Keeps the repo clean |
| Don’t add undocumented code | Others won’t know how to use it |
| Don’t hardcode environment-specific paths or keys | Makes your code non-reusable |

### 👥 Who Can Contribute?
✅ Anyone on the internal team

✅ External collaborators (if granted access)

✅ Anyone building reusable tools, utilities, or helpers

✅ Anyone who benefits from someone else’s code and wants to contribute improvements

💡 This is a public repository, but primarily intended for internal collaboration.
